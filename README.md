Project Overview
This analysis aims to help the marketing department focus on the most important market segment instead of marketing to everyone. We have identified:

1. The top 3 most profitable products based on total sales.
2. The characteristics of the most loyal customers using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis.
3. Hypotheses on why these customers prefer certain products to help in targeted marketing strategies.

Key Findings
1. Top 3 Most Profitable Products
The most profitable products based on total sales are:

Rank	Product Name	Total Sales ($)
1️. Dorito Corn Chp Supreme 380g	40,352.0
2️. Smiths Crnkle Chip Orgnl Big Bag 380g	36,367.6
3️. Smiths Crinkle Chips Salt & Vinegar 330g	34,804.2
Insights:
Large Pack Sizes Dominate → Customers prefer bulk packs over smaller ones.
Brand Loyalty Exists → Doritos and Smiths are strong market leaders.
High Sales from Repeat Customers → These products contribute to long-term customer retention.

Characteristics of the Most Loyal Customers
I used RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value) to segment customers and identify the most loyal ones.

Loyal Customer Segments
1.Frequent & High-Spending Buyers → Likely families and social snackers.
2.Premium Customers → Prefer trusted brands and larger pack sizes.
3.Budget-Conscious Bulk Buyers → Purchase in bulk but less frequently.

Hypothesis on Customer Preferences:
1.Families & Social Snackers → Buy in bulk due to shared consumption.
2.Brand-Conscious Buyers → Prefer trusted names like Smiths & Doritos.
3.Price-Sensitive Shoppers → Stock up during discount periods.
